Proxy
=====

A proxy is an object that implements the same interface as another type of object and can be used in place of it for various reasons.

A proxy can be used, among other things to delay the computation cost of loading expensive objects into memory, add security measures, and anythign else which requires intercepting commands before they reach the desired object.
